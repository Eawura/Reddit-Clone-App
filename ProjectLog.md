# Project Log

## 1. Project Idea and Scope

This project is a clone of Reddit, a popular social media platform where users can share posts, comment, and vote on content. Our goal was to recreate Reddit’s core features in a mobile app using modern technologies and clean design. We also plan to add a special feature that will make the app unique and represent our brand.

## 2. Feature List

- User registration and login
- Profile management
- Post creation, editing, and deletion
- Viewing a feed of posts
- Commenting on posts and replies
- Voting system for posts and comments
- Real-time notifications
- Search functionality
- A special feature unique to our project

## 3. Inspiration Sources

This project is inspired by Reddit’s core features like posting, commenting, and voting. We also focused on making a clean, easy-to-use mobile app and used best practices from modern app development and backend design.

## 4. Tech Stack Used

- **Frontend:** React Native
- **Backend:** Spring Boot
- **Databases:** MongoDB and PostgreSQL
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Tools:** ClickUp (project management), Figma (design mockups)

---

## 5. Design Mockups and Architecture Diagrams

We used Figma to create UI mockups for our mobile app. These mockups helped us design an easy-to-use and modern user interface. We also created architecture diagrams to show how different services (frontend, backend, and databases) connect and communicate.

## 6. Implementation Steps

1. Set up the development environment
2. Design the database schemas and API contracts
3. Build backend microservices using Spring Boot
4. Develop the frontend with React Native
5. Implement user authentication and profile features
6. Add post creation, viewing, commenting, and voting
7. Create real-time notifications and search features
8. Integrate the special feature
9. Test the app thoroughly
10. Deploy using Docker

## 7. Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

- Learning new technologies: Solved by tutorials and team support
- Frontend issues: We had to change the entire frontend structure due to compatibility problems
- API integration: Solved by clear documentation and early testing
- Database setup problems: Solved using official guides and debugging tools
- Time management: Solved by using ClickUp to assign tasks and track progress
